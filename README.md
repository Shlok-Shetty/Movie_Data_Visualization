## Project Overview

This project explores the factors that contribute to a movie’s success using a large-scale, real-world movie dataset. Acting as a data analysis and visualization exercise, the goal was to move beyond basic plotting and use data-driven visual storytelling to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

The project involved formulating a clear hypothesis about movie success, performing non-trivial data preprocessing, and designing visualizations that support or challenge the hypothesis. Key steps included cleaning missing and inconsistent data, transforming nested JSON-style fields into usable features, and creating derived variables such as primary genre and cast size.

Rather than focusing on a single metric, the analysis looks at success from multiple angles—financial performance, audience reception, and production attributes—demonstrating an end-to-end analytical workflow from raw data to narrative insight.
